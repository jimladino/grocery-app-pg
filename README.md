Welcome to my Grocery Menu app!

This is a learning project to build a useful application in rails.

The application allows a user to generate a grocery list based on the selection of his or her meal choices for a given period of time. (For example: Breakfast, Lunch and Supper for one week)  Possible meal selections are created by using two database tables that can be modified by the user. The "Foods" table contains lists of food items that are individually priced.  The "Meals" table lists available Menu items (such as "Spaghetti and Meatballs") and the ingredients required for the meal.  The ingredients are populated from the "Foods" table to make sure ingredient data is the same for all recipes.  Meal planning is made from the "Meal Planning List" from which generates a printable grocery list of items needed to purchase.
